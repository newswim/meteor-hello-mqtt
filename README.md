# meteor-hello-mqtt
The most basic integration of MQTT and Meteor

This is just enough code added to the basic Meteor boilerplate 
to link to an MQTT broker without going through Mongo.

It is NOT a complete app by any means.

See: https://github.com/mkarliner/nodemcu-scripts

for associated ESP8266 scripts.

This application uses init.lua, newmqtt.lua and temperature.lua.
